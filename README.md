# Moodify

Moodify is an iOS application that allows users to write down their thoughts in a journal, where Artificial Intelligence performs analysis and returns custom feedback for the user. The app was created at StarterHacks (Jan 2018), hosted at the University of Waterloo. It was created using Swift, Xcode, and IBM Watson’s API. 

The goal of creating Moodify was to hopefully help improve the mental health of users by providing specifically tailored feedback based on users’ moods. By having instant custom feedback, we hope to strengthen the mental health of users' and prevent situations from escalating.
